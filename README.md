Diabetes is a chronic condition affecting millions worldwide,necessitating early and accurate detection to manage health risks effectively.
Diabetes occurs when blood sugar levels rise due to metabolic problems. This type of exposure can damage various organs and body systems, 
such as the heart, blood vessels, and eyes. It is important to note that these adverse effects are directly caused by hyperglycaemia, 
which is elevated blood sugar levels. This is because the body has trouble controlling blood sugar levels or cannot properly use the insulin it produces. 
The hormone insulin helps glucose reach and be available to the cells. Note that diabetes is divided into two main categories, type 1 and type 2. 
To fully understand type 1 diabetes, it is important to know that it is an autoimmune disease, which means that the bodyâ€™s immune system constantly 
attacks and destroys insulin producing cells.
This project focuses on predicting diabetes by utilising various machine learning classification algorithms. The goal is to analyze patient data, 
identify potential indicators of diabetes, and enhance prediction accuracy.Techniques like Decision Trees, Random Forest and Logistic Regression
are employed to classify data based on attributes such as age, HbA1c,glucose levels, and other relevant factors. By comparing the performance
of different algorithms, the project aims to identify the most effective model for diabetes prediction. This approach not only highlights the 
strengths and limitations of each method but also emphasises the importance of machine learning in healthcare, offering a data-driven
solution to improve early diagnosis and patient outcomes.
